Hi! I am a PhD student in [Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu) at [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu) since 2022 fall. I am co-advised by [Prof. Darko Marinov](https://mir.cs.illinois.edu/marinov/) and [Prof. Reyhaneh Jabbarvand](https://reyhaneh.cs.illinois.edu). 

My research lies in AI and software engineering (SE):
- LLM-based systems that integrate program analysis to address real-world
problems, e.g., Agentic SWE issue repair and flaky tests repair;

- Synthetic data generation to benchmark LLMs on complex coding tasks with
real-world difficulty, study LLM code reasoning capabilities, and evaluate
flakiness detection tools;

- Post-training of LLMs using high-quality synthetic data.

- My ongoing research focuses on building agentic systems for efficient code
generation and conducting process-centric analysis of agents.

- Others. Prior research projects have also equipped me with diverse skills in neu-
rosymbolic program analysis, genetic algorithms and LLM fine-tuning, as well as
software testing including flaky tests detection & repair (accumulating to 139
patches accepted in real world), mutation testing and test suite minimization.
