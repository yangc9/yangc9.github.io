Hi! I am a PhD student in [Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu) at [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu) since 2022 fall. I am co-advised by [Prof. Darko Marinov](https://mir.cs.illinois.edu/marinov/) and [Prof. Reyhaneh Jabbarvand](https://reyhaneh.cs.illinois.edu). 

My research lies in AI and Software Engineering (SE):
- LLM-based systems integrated with program analysis to address real-world SE problems, such as agentic SWE issue repair and flaky test repair.
- Synthetic data generation to evaluate LLMs on complex coding tasks with real-world difficulty, study LLM code reasoning capabilities, and assess test flakiness detection tools.
- Post-training of LLMs using high-quality synthetic data.
- My ongoing research focuses on agentic systems for efficient code generation and debugging, and perform process-centric analysis of agents.
- Prior research has also equipped me with a broad skill set such as neurosymbolic program analysis, genetic algorithms, LLM fine-tuning, flaky test detection and repair (139 patches accepted in real-world projects), mutation testing, and test-suite minimization.
